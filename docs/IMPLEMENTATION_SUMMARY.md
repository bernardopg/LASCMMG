### 2. ✅ Fix AI_RULES.md (JavaScript not TypeScript)

**File**: `/AI_RULES.md`

**Changes**:

- Updated language declaration from TypeScript to JavaScript (ES6+)
- Fixed all markdown linting errors (list markers, indentation, spacing)
- Changed file extension references:
  - `src/App.tsx` → `src/App.jsx`
  - `src/services/api.ts` → `src/services/api.js`
- Added note about TypeScript dependencies being for future migration
- Fixed markdown formatting to comply with linter rules

**Impact**: Documentation now accurately reflects the current codebase. AI assistants and developers will have correct guidance.

### 3. ✅ Create .env.example File

**File**: `/.env.example`

**Changes**:

- Created comprehensive environment variable template
- Organized into logical sections:
  - Server configuration
  - CORS settings
  - Security keys (JWT, Cookie, CSRF)
  - Rate limiting
  - Database configuration
  - Redis configuration
  - Logging
  - File uploads
  - Email (optional)
- Added detailed comments for each variable
- Included security notes and best practices
- Provided example values for development
- Added warnings about production security

**Impact**: New developers can quickly set up their environment. Clear documentation of all configuration options.

### 4. ✅ Replace console.log with Logger in Backend

**Files Modified**:

- `/backend/simple-setup-db.js`
- `/backend/setup-db.js`

**Changes**:

- Added comments explaining that console statements are acceptable in CLI scripts
- Documented distinction between server code (use logger) and utility scripts (console OK)
- Verified that main scripts (`manage-database.js`, `health-check.js`) already have proper `/* eslint-disable no-console */` directives
- Added explanatory comments for future maintainers

**Impact**: Clear guidance on when to use console vs logger. Reduced linting confusion.

---

### 5. ✅ Document TypeScript Dependencies Decision

**File**: `/docs/TYPESCRIPT_MIGRATION.md`

**Changes**:

- Created comprehensive TypeScript migration guide
- Documented current status (JavaScript with TS dependencies)
- Explained purpose of TypeScript dependencies:
  - Type checking support
  - IDE improvements
  - Future migration readiness
- Provided complete migration strategy:
  - 4-phase incremental approach
  - Backend conversion plan
  - Frontend conversion plan
  - Strictness configuration
- Included sample `tsconfig.json` files for both backend and frontend
- Listed pros and cons of migration
- Provided decision checkpoint questions
- Documented alternative approach (JSDoc types)
- Added recommendation to keep dependencies for now

**Impact**: Clear understanding of TypeScript situation. Roadmap available if team decides to migrate.

### 6. ✅ Add Comprehensive Testing Suite Foundation

**Files Created**:

- `/docs/TESTING.md` - Complete testing guide
- `/backend/tests/unit/validationUtils.test.js` - Example unit tests
- `/backend/tests/integration/auth.test.js` - Example integration tests

**Changes**:

#### Documentation (`TESTING.md`)

- Documented complete testing stack
- Provided test structure guidelines
- Added commands for running tests
- Included examples for:
  - Backend unit tests
  - Backend integration tests
  - Frontend component tests
  - Frontend hook tests
  - E2E tests with Cypress
- Defined test coverage goals
- Listed testing best practices
- Provided CI/CD integration example

#### Example Tests

- **Unit Test** (`validationUtils.test.js`):
  - Password validation tests
  - Email validation tests
  - Edge case handling

- **Integration Test** (`auth.test.js`):
  - User registration flow
  - Login authentication
  - Protected routes
  - Token validation
  - Logout functionality

**Impact**: Testing framework foundation established. Developers have clear examples and guidelines for writing tests.
